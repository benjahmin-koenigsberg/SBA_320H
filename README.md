### Project name and introduction

This is a class project for the Per Scholas[https://perscholas.org] React.js developer bootcamp

I created an app to prompt users with a choice: either view a random image of a cat, dog, duck, or foxfrom a public API or learn about the plight of these animals in captivity.

I spend several hours searching for a cool API to use that could hold my interest while building an app and that would not be too difficult to work with.

### Challenges

I ran into a lot of difficulty with CORS error when making simple GET requests to free and public APIs. I tried using different browsers and making requests with diffrent headers and configs.

I ended up using a free proxy service to make a few of the API calls

I have had success with COR blocking web extensions, although I know those won't work in production

I will need to spend more time, building more apps with Redux to feel proficent using it

I really enjoy Boostrap and think I like it it better than Tailwind although I still need to improve with basic responsive layout CSS

I would also like to learn how to use the Cloudinary API

### Features to Add

I would like to add slides for more animals and include more links and calls to actions to help captive and wild animals
