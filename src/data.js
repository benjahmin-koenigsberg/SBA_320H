The females are killed right away, because the structure of their liver makes them unsuitable for the forced feeding process. The males are cruelly debeaked in order to avoid too many losses due to fighting. A duck's liver naturally weighs around 50 grams.However, to qualify as foie gras, the industry's own regulations require ducks' livers to weigh an absolute minimum of 300 grams. The vast amounts of feed pumped down the ducks' throats causes enormous internal pressure, and the pipe sometimes punctures the esophagus, causing many to die from choking on the blood that fills their lungs. Some birds literally burst or choke to death on their own vomit. Other ducks die a slow, painful, and premature death by suffocation from inhalation of regurgitated feed.",
